                                                      ## DOCKER PROJECT 

This is a very basic project using Docker to set-up Nextcloud. Nextcloud is free and open-source application which functions similar to Dropbox or Google Drive.

                                                      
                                                     ## Softwares or Packages Used :- 
                                                     
I used **Redhat Enterprise Linux** RHEL 8. On top of it, I used Docker and Docker Compose. Dockercompose needs to be installed seperately.
