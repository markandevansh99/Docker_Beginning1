# DOCKER PROJECT 

This is a very basic project using Docker to set-up Nextcloud. Nextcloud is free and open-source application which functions similar to Dropbox or Google Drive.

                                                      
## Softwares or Packages Used :- 
                                                     
I used **Redhat Enterprise Linux** RHEL 8. On top of it, I used Docker and Docker Compose. Dockercompose needs to be installed seperately.



## Downloading or Pulling ( In Docker Jargon) the Important Images :-

- Pulling MySQL image :-

I used ***docker pull mysql:5.7*** to download the mysql version 5.7 image to use as a database server.

- Pulling Nextcloud Image :-

I used ***docker pull nextcloud:latest*** to download the latest version of Nextcloud application.


## Installing Docker Compose

We need to install the docker-compose software in order to use it. To install docker-compose.
**Go to google --> In the search box search docker compose rpm --> Choose Install Docker compose --> Based on the base OS select whether Mac, Windows or Linux etc. --> Copy the command and paste it in the terminal of the base OS.
